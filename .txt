W12C: HTTP Request Types
Due Saturday by 11:59pm Points 1 Submitting a website url
We have really powered up our Axios ability with the new kinds of request types available to us. We can now play around with test API services like https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide/ Links to an external site. 

This is a service that allows you to try out learning things like POST, PATCH, DELETE and GET requests in a fake environment.

 

Setup a GitHub repository and local git repository
Setup the index.html to link to your app.js file and do the following:
Make a POST request that creates a "post"
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts Links to an external site.is the endpoint for this action
There should be a form with a button that allows users to type in their post and click send
If it succeeds, the user should be shown a success message
Make a PATCH request that updates a "post"
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1 Links to an external site.is an example endpoint for this action
This request can simply happen when the page loads (or on a button press if you're feeling fancy)
If it succeeds, add a success message onto the page.
Make a DELETE request that deletes a "post"
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1 Links to an external site.is an example endpoint for this action
This request can simply happen when the page loads (or on a button press if you're feeling fancy)
If it succeeds, add a success message onto the page.
Make a GET request that grabs all "posts"
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts Links to an external site.is the endpoint for this action
This request should happen automatically when the page loads
If it succeeds, all the posts should display on the page somehow (think loop)
BONUS:
Each post also has "comments" related to it. Read the API docs and for each post, also display the comments for that post.
Add for request success, loading, and failure messages to the user when appropriate.
 

Add, Commit, and Push all your changes to GitHub when you finish.
